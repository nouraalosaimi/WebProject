# Business Logic 
The three data blocks that comprise the core of our database are a user's name, an email address, and a password.
We just created a simple nodejs (express) server and connected that server to a MongoDB, then at signup page we simply put all data (name , email and password) from user and save that data to MongoDB then at login we get email and password from user (login page) and match that email and password with the stored email in mongoddb.

The app.get method routes the HTTP GET Requests to the path which is being specified with the specified callback functions.

We use the app.post method and then we specify the route, and we have a callback
